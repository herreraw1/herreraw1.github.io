=======

Hello! My name is William and I was born in Naples, FL, and currently live in a small town called Immokalee. 

The reason I enrolled into Computer Systems and Information Technology is that I gain more knowlege of the curriculm, and gain some sort of hands on experience and real world problem solving, while also dealing with networking and computer basics.

My professional goals are securing a high paying job into the computer or networking industry and work with companies/corprate jobs with the high demand of people going into networking.
